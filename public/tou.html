Terms of Use
Welcome

Welcome to Nabo, the online home for your neighbourhood. The Terms of Use Agreement describes your rights and responsibilities as a Nabo member and in turn, what you can expect from us.



Terms & Conditions

The Terms and Conditions set out in this agreement (“Terms”), govern your access to and use of the Nabo websites and services (“Services”), and any information, text, graphics, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (“Content”).

Permission to access and use the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.



Terms of use

Nabo reserves the right to change these Terms at any time. We will notify you of that change by sending you an email or by posting a website notice. By continuing to use Nabo, you consent to be bound by the amended terms of use.



The Service

You understand that the Services which Nabo provides will go through periods of development and improvement, and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time, without notice. Furthermore, Nabo may cease (permanently or temporarily) to provide the Services (or any features within the Services) and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.



Accepting the Terms

In order to access the Services, you must agree to the Terms. If you do not accept the Terms, you may not use the Services.

You can accept the Terms by completing and submitting the website registration form.

You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if you are under thirteen years of age. We may deny account registrations we think would harm a Nabo suburb e.g. registered sex offenders.

Upon creating an account with Nabo, or by using the Nabo site in any way, you agree to be bound by these terms (the Terms), the Nabo Code of Conduct and the Privacy Policy.

You must be at least 13 years old to use Nabo.
You must use your real name and provide your current residential address when you register.
You confirm that information provided to Nabo is current and accurate at the time of providing the information.
Nabo may use the information provided by you as part of the registration process to verify the accuracy of that information (including contacting you using this information).
To become a Member of Nabo we require you to authenticate your address of residence through a verification process determined by Nabo. Please refer to the ‘Help’ section for information on address verification. Should you be unable to complete address verification, you will not be eligible to be a Member.
Nabo will take all practical steps to ensure that a Member's address is verified correctly but we are unable to guarantee complete accuracy.
Should you login to Nabo via Facebook, you will remain bound by the terms of those services when you are using them and you provide us with the authority to copy your Facebook membership details to Nabo.
You must not share your account password.
You may not use your personal Member account for commercial gain (i.e. pyramid selling schemes).
Registered sex offenders are not eligible for Nabo accounts.
Nabo may deny account registrations that we think may harm a Nabo suburb.
Nabo reserves the right to refuse or discontinue any Member account registration.


Third Party Marketing

We understand that by joining a Nabo website you do not necessarily want to receive third party marketing. As such, Nabo does not provide your personally identifiable information to third party marketers.



Content Ownership

All of the content and information you post on Nabo is owned by you. We can publish your Content in your suburb or to nearby suburbs as described in our privacy policy.

In addition: For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Nabo ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others). When you publish content using parts of the Services which are available to everyone, it means that you are allowing everyone, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (e.g. your username and profile picture).

You may not provide us with any Content that you do not own or have the right to publish, or that is defamatory, infringing, illegal or otherwise wrongful.

All Content uploaded by you will be available to those persons as determined by you in your Nabo settings and can be collected and used by others.

Nabo endeavours to ensure that your Content is only available to those persons determined by your Nabo settings, however Nabo will not be held responsible should other people gain access to your Content.

Nabo cannot control who reads your Content or what others may do with the information you choose to publicise. Therefore, we encourage you to think before you post, and only talk about topics that you would be happy sharing with your neighbours.

Nabo may display property data provided by PSMA Australia Limited ACN 089 912 710. This data is provided for your personal use only and you acknowledge that you do not hold any intellectual property rights in the data. You may not reproduce the data, alter it, on-license it or produce a hard copy for non-personal use.



Content on the Services

All Content, whether posted publicly or communicated privately, is the sole responsibility of the person who created such Content. Nabo cannot regulate the Content published via the Services and whilst all reasonable efforts of moderation will be made, we cannot take responsibility for such Content.

The reliance and use of any Content or resources posted via the Services or acquired by you through the Services is at your own risk.

Nabo does not support, represent, endorse or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services.

You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that could be deemed offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been categorised incorrectly or are deceptive.

Under no circumstances will Nabo be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, errors or omissions, or any loss or damage of any kind experienced as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.
