## SYNOPSIS

This community website is my final project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. It aims to allow residents and different groups to participate in information exchange to bond people together.


## GENERAL APP FEATURES

Features users' registration and login, message exchange, event & blog publishing and online exchange of goods and services.  registration for single/double players, embedded midi/mp3, possibly weave some animations included. It currently runs on desktop web-browser, eventually to be deployed IOS and Android if permitted.


## CODE DESCRIPTION

Use of Express, javascript, basic CSS functionalities, sliders for slide effect, MongoDB for database hosting.

## MOTIVATION

It came from my impending relocation to a new HDB BTO in Woodlands Glen, Singapore in Year 2017.  It is a small community with 888 households and I thought it will be great if a platform can be created to encourage residents to use and share information to forge closer community ties.
